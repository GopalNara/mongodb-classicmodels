# mongodb-classicmodels
MongoDB / CSV version of the ClassicModels sample database.

This came from here:

http://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx

which in turn likely came from here:

To use it, just run the mongo-import.sh script.

If you want it to go into a different database, edit the mongo-import.sh script and change each occurance of "ClassicModels" to whatever you like.
